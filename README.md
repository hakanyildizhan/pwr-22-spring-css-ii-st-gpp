#Target platform
- Web browsers (compatibility with Chrome, Safari, Opera, Firefox and Edge)

# Scalability requirements
- Given that the project requires free disk space in order to provide it to users, we assume that each 
user will need about 100MB of free space. As the free/test/student version of resources allow storing up to 20 GB of data
for free, we assume that the project might scale up to 200 users.
- Taking into account the above estimate, our endpoints should handle the load around 200 requests per minute
